In this project, i will implement from scratch, without any library, a web page. I will use all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design knowledges that i have learned previously.

I donâ€™t have a lot of instruction, i'm free to implement it the way that i want - the objective is simple: Have a fully functional web page that looks the same as the designer file. This webpage has been designed by Nicolas Philippot, UI/UX designer.

Requirements
you are not allowed to import external CSS framework (like Bootstrap)
you are not to use Javascript
